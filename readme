yard-algo.
    Implementation of Shunting-yard algorithm created by "Edsger W. Dijkstra", this algorithm lets to any program
    parse a infix notation expression to a postfix notation, which is so helpful to solve arithemetic expressions,
    since that notations does not requiere the use of parentheses. The algorithm is already done for operations
    such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, but i'll be adding more to make it stronger ;).
